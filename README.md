[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2lqpbhv71sc97ip9/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dpottavio/combatden/branch/master)

Combat Den is a work-in-progress project to provide simple randomized
missions for Arma 3.  A single mission file provides a number of
re-playable missions, no two missions are the same.

## How can I play?

It's simple.  A randomized mission will be selected complete with a
briefing.  Just play.

## Features
* Single player support.
* 8 player coop support on a dedicated server or player hosted server.
* Zeus support.
* ACE support, but not required.
* Virtual Arsenal for player and AI units.
* Configurable mission settings.
* Multiple distinct mission types complete with briefing.
* Multi terrain support.
* Optional third party factions from RHS, CUP, 3CB, and more.
* GM support.

## Required Mods

The following mods are the minimum required dependencies.  Mission
files on non-vanilla terrains will require additional dependencies.

to see, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/dpottavio/CombatDen/issues) and describe in

the feature should "make sense" in the context of the mission.  Use
your best judgment.

Depending on the amount of work, feature requests may take some time
to complete.  The best way to expedite this process is to make the
change yourself and make a Pull-Request to the project.  Pull-Requests
take priority over enhancement requests regardless of size.
