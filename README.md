# Combat Den

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2lqpbhv71sc97ip9/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dpottavio/combatden/branch/master)

Combat Den is a work-in-progress project to provide simple randomized
missions for Arma 3.  A single mission file provides a number of
re-playable missions, no two mission play throughs are the same.

## How can I play?

It's simple.  A randomized mission will be selected complete with a
briefing.  Just play.

## Features
* Single player support.
* 8 player coop support on a dedicated server or player hosted server.
* Zeus support.
* Built for ACE 3 from the ground up.
* Virtual Arsenal for player and AI units.
* Configurable mission settings.
* 7 randomized mission types complete with briefing.
* Multi terrain support.
* Support for RHS, CUP, and 3CB BAF.  See Mod Support below.

## Mission Settings

Mission settings are available through the [CBA Settings
System](url=https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/wiki/CBA-Settings-System).
Access to the settings menu is available through the 'Configure
Addons' button during the mission briefing.

## Virtual Arsenal

The ACE Virtual Arsenal (VA) is available in the crates at the start
of each mission.  You must use the ACE interact key on the crates to
open the VA and custom loadout menu.

## Required Mods

The following mods are the minimum required dependencies.  Mission
files on non-vanilla terrains will require additional dependencies.
