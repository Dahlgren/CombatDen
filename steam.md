[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Welcome to the Combat Den!  This is a work-in-progress project to provide randomized missions using ACE 3.  The goal is to have a set of simple mission types that are replayable for single and 8-player multi-coop.

Is this yet another random mission generator?  Well yes.  However, the focus for Combat Den is simplicity, and the use of ACE 3.  Missions are short and sweet with 1-3 objectives.  As for ACE 3 support, rather than just providing "compatibility", Combat Den embraces it.

[h1]How can I play?[/h1]
It's simple.  A randomized mission will be selected complete with a briefing.  Just play.

In multiplayer you can toggle some of the mission parameters through the parameter menu in the lobby.  Single player does not yet have a means to do this.  If you would like to change parameters as a single player, you can play solo in multiplayer.

[h1]How does it work?[/h1]
There are a fix set of mission types that have static objectives.  However, the location and enemy parameters are chosen randomly.  The design is somewhere inbetween mbrdmn's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=722652837]Dynamic Recon Ops[/url] and BI's [url=https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/MP_Combat_Patrol]Combat Patrol[/url].

[h1]What mission types are supported?[/h1]
This is the current set of supported mission types.  This list is a work-in-progress and will expand as missions are developed.

[*] Area Clearing
[*] Chemical Weapon Extraction
