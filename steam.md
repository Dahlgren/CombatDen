[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Combat Den is a work-in-progress project to provide randomized missions using ACE 3.  The goal is to have a set of simple mission types that are re-playable for single and 8-player coop.  

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Single player support.
[*] 8 player coop support on a dedicated server or player hosted server. 
[*] Built for ACE 3 from the ground up.
[*] Virtual Arsenal for player and AI units.
[*] Configurable mission parameters under multi-player. Single player does not yet have a means to do this.  If you would like to change parameters as a single player, you can play solo in multiplayer.
[*] 6 randomized mission types complete with briefing.
[*] Multi terrain support.  See Combat Den collection for full list.

[h1]How can I play?[/h1]  
It's simple.  A randomized mission will be selected complete with a briefing.  Just play. 

[h1]How does it work?[/h1]  
There are a fix set of mission types that have static objectives.  However, the location and enemy parameters are chosen randomly.  The design is somewhere inbetween mbrdmn's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=722652837]Dynamic Recon Ops[/url] and BI's [url=https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/MP_Combat_Patrol]Combat Patrol[/url].  

If you find a bug, have questions, or want to give feedback, please post on this workshop page.  Enjoy!
