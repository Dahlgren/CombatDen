[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Combat Den is a work-in-progress project to provide simple randomized missions for single and 8 player coop.  A single mission file provides a number of re-playable missions, no two mission play throughs are same.

[h1]How can I play?[/h1]
It's simple.  A randomized mission will be selected complete with a briefing.  Just play.

[h1]Virtual Arsenal[/h1]
The ACE Virtual Arsenal (VA) is available in the crates at the start of each mission.  You must use the ACE interact key on the crates to open the VA and custom loadout menu.

[h1]RHS Support[/h1]
Loading RHS based mods will replace default factions.  It is recommend to install RHSAFRF, RHSUSAF, and ProjectOPFOR together.  However, this is not necessary.
[list]
[*] RHSAFRF replaces CSAT forces with Russia.
[*] RHSUSAF replaces NATO forces with USMC.
[*] ProjectOPFOR adds various enemy factions depending on the terrian.
[/list]

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*] Some people have experienced invisible barriers at the initial staging area.  I have not been able to reproduce this issue and as a result do not have a fix in the works.  Sorry.
